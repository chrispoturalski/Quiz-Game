## H2 Challenge

# Description

In this project, we were tasked with creating a functional quiz game app that includes a start screen, a question screen, along with a high score screen. When asked a series of questions, we are task 
with logging each result whether you answered the question correctly or incorrectly, subtract time if you missed a question, and then log a score at the end. For my quiz I logged a score for questions
correct + time left. For example, if the game was 60 seconds long and you answered all 5 questions right within 15 seconds - you would achieve a score of 5 (for questions correct) + 45 (for seconds remaining). The final screen would then take you to a highscore table.
